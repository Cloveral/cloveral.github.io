		<h1>Who we are</h1>
		<p>A vision that becomes reality. All is based on a spreadsheet opened to try to optimize the design of rubber moulds. The will to translate the results obtained into a user-friendly instrument led to the birth of Cloveral in 2016.</p>
		<p>The company is the result of the meeting of three professionals with complementary skills in mechanical and computer engineering applied to production processes. Cloveral's goal is to design and develop software to improve the competitiveness of enterprises by optimizing time and resources.</p>

		<h2>Agile, by nature</h2>
		<p>
			Being software developer today means adopting development methods and procedures that reflect the specific needs of a ever - evolving market with focused, dynamic and sustainable solutions.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this reason in Cloveral we decided to embrace the Agile Manifesto Philosophy, a less structured software development approach, that pursues the goal of delivering a functioning and quality application with several release to customer as soon as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Agile development Manifesto regards as more important:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Persons and interactions than processes and instruments
			</li>
			<li>
				The functioning software than exhaustive documentation
			</li>
			<li>
				The collaboration with the customer than negotiation of contracts
			</li>
			<li>
				React to the change than follow a plan.
			</li>
		</ul>
